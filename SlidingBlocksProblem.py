Assignment 3 Part II. Eight Puzzle with 4 different heuristics functions

A QUIET Solving Tool problem formulation.
QUIET = Quetzal User Intelligence Enhancing Technology.
The XML-like tags used here serve to identify key sections of this
problem formulation.

CAPITALIZED constructs are generally present in any problem
formulation and therefore need to be spelled exactly the way they are.
Other globals begin with a capital letter but otherwise are lower
case or camel case.
